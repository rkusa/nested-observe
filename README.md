## Compatability

`nested-observe` internally uses `WeakMap` (for garbage collection). Node.js supports both `WeakMap` and `Object.observe` since version `0.11.13`. For browsers have a look at: [kangax's compaitibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es7/#Object.observe). For unsupported browsers/Node.js, you can use shims, e.g. [KapIT/observe-shim](https://github.com/KapIT/observe-shim) and [Benvie/WeakMap](https://github.com/Benvie/WeakMap).

## Api

```js
var Nested = require('nested-observe')
Nested.observe(root, callback, accept)
Nested.unobserve(root, callback)
Nested.deliverChangeRecords(callback)
```

Delivered change records contain two additional properties:

- **root** - the root of the nested structure
- **path** - a [JSON Pointer](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) (absolute from the root) to the changed property

### Debugging

By default, `Object.observe` ignores errors occuring during change record delivery. To simplify debugging, you can set `Nested.debug = true`, which will log such errors to the console.
